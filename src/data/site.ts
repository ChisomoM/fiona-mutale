  profile: `A proactive NetSuite professional focused on cultivating positive and productive relationships. I excel in NetSuite’s core accounting and finance functionality—account configuration, data migration, testing, and end-user adoption.

I am also a seasoned Management Accountant and Financial Systems SME with over a decade of experience across media, retail, and IT. I bring expertise in financial analysis, systems, budgeting & forecasting, and reporting. Accustomed to Agile working, I have a passion for continuous self-development to keep pace with this dynamic environment.

I have a proven record of working with C-level staff to support internal system growth and am recognised for refined interpersonal skills and a friendly, approachable style that complements my technical and financial strengths.`,
